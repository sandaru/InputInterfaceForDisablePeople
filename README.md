# InputInterfaceForDisablePeople
People who have serious disabilities cannot use any kind of stationary or computer  in their day today life. Especially the people who cannot work their legs and arms  are suffering a lot from this problem. Although they need to interact with the world,  it is impossible due to their special necessities. There are several systems that  enable retarded people to work with computers which are high in cost and hard to  maintain. This study is providing a free and open source, voice and head movement  based input interface that directly address the above problems by providing a  convenient computer input interface. This interface provides a virtual keyboard and  a cursor controlling mechanism for the windows operating system.
